  <p> Welcome to Hello Art.
   If you're like me, and you have a really important art ptoject/assesment comming up at at school and you have no idea of what you're going to hand in, than we can help you.
 But if you're someone who's looking for a picture to sketch, than thats okay too. We have a lot of suggestions here that might suit you.
Okay lets get started!  </p>

<h3>
If you wanna draw something for yourself, maybe you're trying to create a peice of art that reresents you, then maybe you should brainstorm first.
Try and brainstorm all of your interests.
